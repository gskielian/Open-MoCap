# Open-MoCap
Exploration of embedded methods for achieving real-time partial motion capture for VR applications.

## Methods of interest

* GVect -- gravity vector extraction
* Magnetic-Pivot -- two-part system, magnets and magnetometers at strategic joints

## Project Goals:

* in-obtrusive: embedded, small, lightweight
* drift-free for time of interest -- or with a natural method of recalibrating
